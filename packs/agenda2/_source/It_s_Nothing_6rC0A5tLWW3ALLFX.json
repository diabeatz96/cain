    "abilityDescription": "You can ignore taking an injury by saying ‘It’s Nothing’. Gain a hook ‘It’s Nothing’. This hook fills up any time you say ‘It’s Nothing’ as well as the normal ways (taking this hook again, time passing, rolling a ‘1’). Segments on the hook can’t be erased in any way. When the hook fills out, you collapse and suffer instant death, which you cannot ignore. If you end a mission with this hook, you gain a permanent cosmetic scar.",
