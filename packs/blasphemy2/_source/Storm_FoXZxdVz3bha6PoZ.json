Any precipitation becomes snow. \n• Fog: Thick fog rolls in, limiting visibility. \n• Gale: Whipping wind rolls through the area, blowing away fog, smoke, or dust, and making it hard to hear or be outside. \n        \nThis power may easily effect the parameters of rolls, such as difficulty and risk.\n\n Once used, lose the use of this power until you rest.",
