The combined size of the object or being and the range you send them must equal your CAT+2 or less. Once sent flying, the direction of your target cannot be changed.\n\nYou can alternately remove all velocity by touching an object or person of CAT+2 size, bringing it to a complete stop.\n\nRoll PSYCHE for its effects, including any harm inflicted, and only spend a psyche burst on at least one success.",
