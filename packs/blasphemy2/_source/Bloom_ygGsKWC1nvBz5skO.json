They are stuck in place and cannot move. Gain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power:\n        \n• You can control them like your normal limbs, making action rolls through them and you have normal sensation with them. \n• They can be placed on any surface, including moving surfaces or living beings. \n• You take any stress they would take from your actions made through them.",
