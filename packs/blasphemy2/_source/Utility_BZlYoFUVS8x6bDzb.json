    "powerDescription": "When you need any mundane object, tool, or vehicle that could fit in a small room, you can cause it to appear on a surface in range as though it was always there, without spending KP. However, the Admin chooses one, or two if the item is dangerous or rare:\n        \n• The item is used, dented, scuffed, or poor quality\n• The item is a real item that someone nearby owned and has now disappeared, and they will come looking for it\n• The item is ‘off’ somehow and appears as a cheap knockoff made of odd materials that feel spongey or organic.\n• The item is missing some parts and doesn’t work as well as it could with them\n        \nThe item cannot be a unique item, etc you cannot create a particular car, key, book, etc, but is rather a generic representative of a category. It disappears after a rest.",
