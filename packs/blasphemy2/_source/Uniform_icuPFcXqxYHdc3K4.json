This power makes you officially part of any profession or group with more than 5 members, with any necessary uniform, equipment, id cards, memberships, etc, and alters reality to make it so.\n        \nEven if people don’t particularly remember you being part of a group, they may get a vague sense that you were a member.\n        \nYou don’t actually gain any particular skills and any changes you may have to be to your own person and must include things you could wear or carry in one or both hands.\n        \nGain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power.",
