    "powerDescription": "You create a weaker, but persistent Vector force in an area that lasts until you rest. It creates a line that goes about {<CAT> range 2} range in length and covers about the width of a street. It pushes constantly in one direction (including up or down) like a strong wind. Allies moving in that direction gain +1D on actions to move with the current. Anything moving against that direction struggles. It becomes hard for allies, and actions taken against anyone trying to struggle against the current gain +1D. You can dismiss this effect at will.",
