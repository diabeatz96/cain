You can change any of the following about yourself when resting, within a variation of your original body:\n\n• body features such as height and weight\n• aesthetics such as facial features, skin color, hair, gender presentation\n• age, down to 13 and up to 88\n\nYou always look faintly similar, like a distant relative of yourself. Your clothes always change to fit you, though you cannot alter them. This doesn’t change anything about your skills or general ability, and also cannot restore missing body parts or hide sin marks or scars.",
