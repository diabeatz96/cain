For the scene, you automatically have resonance with it, and its properties are enhanced to extreme levels, as if they were up to your CAT in scale. For example:\n        \n• A car’s speed, handling, and resilience\n• A light’s brightness and intensity, and the area it illuminates\n• A door’s ability to lock and withstand force\n        \nThis can easily affect the difficulty and risk of rolls.",
