    "powerDescription": "You can choose a single living being or object you can see. The combined size of the object or being and the distance you attempt to move them must be CAT+2 or less. Roll PSYCHE if your target is unwilling, only spending a psyche burst on success. As long as you can see your target, on at least one success, you can pinch space between the two of you to move your target right next to you. From the targets perspective, they don’t appear to move at all, but the world smears around them. They ignore all physical obstructions between them and you - as long as you can see your target, they simply appear next to you. \n        \nYou may gain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power.",
