    "powerDescription": "When you are looking for a human, sin, exorcist, location, or object, you can declare ‘I feel a shiver’. You send a psychic pulse out to {<CAT> range 0} in a radius around you, which remains active for this scene. While your target is close enough to be in range, you feel a strong sense of cold and discomfort. You can home in on this feeling easily. It’s never hard to track your target while this power is active. If your target is in short range of you, you also gain +1D on any rolls to track or locate them.",
