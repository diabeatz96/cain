Supernatural beings are immune this effect. Unwilling humans might require a rolling PSYCHE to possess successfully.\n        \n• While possessing another your real body is insensate and defenseless\n• For humans and animals, you cannot force a target to harm itself or take action that would indirectly cause it to come to harm\n• Actions that the target takes use your action ratings, but the target’s body or equipment, which might change the circumstances\n        \nYou are kicked out of the body if it takes stress",
