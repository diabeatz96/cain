The beam goes in a straight line a range equal to {<CAT> distance_normal}, piercing through walls, doors, and obstructions effortlessly. It is extremely loud and bright. Roll PSYCHE for its effects, only spending a psyche burst on success. \n\nFor every ‘6’ result you roll, this ability inflicts 1 extra slash on a talisman, but you also take 2 stress, which could kill you or cause you an injury. This stress cannot be reduced or ignored in any way.",
