    "afflictionDescription": "Can be inflicted as a threat or from a hook. When filled up, eyes become milky white and exorcist becomes unable to see, making activities that rely on sight hard. At the end of mission, roll 1d6, on a ‘1’ this becomes permanent, but exorcist has time to adjust to disability at the start of next mission and it has no further effect. Blind exorcists are immune to this affliction.",
