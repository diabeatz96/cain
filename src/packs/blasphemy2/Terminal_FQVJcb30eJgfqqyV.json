    "powerDescription": "You manifest a computer terminal that emerges harmlessly (but somewhat disturbingly) from your body, usually from your chest or back. While manifesting this terminal, activities are hard if you are moving or under duress, but you can otherwise act normally, including typing or interfacing from yourself. The terminal has a fast connection to the internet and is powered, regardless of location. Any other character interacting with the terminal can use <b>your</b> relevant skills to gather information using you. The first time in a scene someone gathers information this way, also gain +1D.",
