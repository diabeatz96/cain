Then narrate a sentence using the following structure:\n\n<b>(He/she/they) was/were (verb)ing the (noun).</b>\n\nFor example: He was opening the door.\nShe was falling in the air.\nHe was driving the car.\nThey were lying on the floor.\n\nRoll PSYCHE for its effects, and only spend a PSYCHE burst on a success. After the sentence finishes and if the roll is successful, it becomes true, including moving any affected people where they need to be as if they were always there. This power does not adjust human memory nor can it create anything, change anyone, or directly harm anyone (it could still easily harm someone indirectly, as you can see from the examples).",
