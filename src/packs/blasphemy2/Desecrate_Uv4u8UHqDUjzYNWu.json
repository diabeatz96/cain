    "powerDescription": "You can force a semblance of life into the corpses of up to {<CAT> people 0} humans or exorcists by touching them on the eyes. You may ask the corpse(s) three questions total (no matter how many you animate), after which the effect ends and it becomes dead again. It also expires if the hour passes. \n        \n• You can’t use this power on the same corpse more than once \n• The power does not return life to the body, but accesses the body’s memories. If the head or brain is missing, or the body lacks a tongue, etc, this power will not work as well. \n• The corpse is obligated to answer truthfully, but can only speak to the realm of its knowledge and memories before it died. It may have only partial knowledge of a situation or may speak according to its own viewpoint. \n        \nThen lose the use of this power until you rest.",
