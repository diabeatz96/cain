    "powerDescription": "You can shunt your perception out of your body and roam for {<CAT> range 2} range, becoming a being made of purely psychic energy. \n        \n• While practicing this power, your real body is insensate and defenseless \n• You can fly at {<CAT> speed 0} speed, are invisible to those not psychically sensitive, and may pass through walls, floors, and objects easily while in this form. \n• You cannot interact with or be affected by the physical world. You cannot use or benefit from your own psychic powers, but psychic powers or effects from others can still affect you.  \n        \nIf your form is destroyed somehow (by a supernatural force), you take 1 stress, this power ends, and you can’t use this power again until the scene passes. \n        \nThis power may easily effect the parameters of rolls, such as difficulty and risk.",
