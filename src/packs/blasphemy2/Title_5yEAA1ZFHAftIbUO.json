    "powerDescription": "You play a track from your playlist. You can manifest in short range from you a psychic manifestation based on any part of the title, up to CAT in size or magnitude. The effect can create:\n\n• A psychic copy of any object named in the title\n• A psychic copy of any human or animal in the title\n• A brief burst or energy, weather, or physical force (fire/rain/wind/push/pull/pressure) named in the title\n\nThe manifestation lasts until you would roll for its effects or actions, until you use this power again, or until the scene passes, then it dissipates. Anything created is tangible but has an aura of unreality or ‘wrongness’ around it to regular humans, who will catch on under close inspection. It can cause tangible harm or force and interact with the physical world but is in no way obligated to follow your instructions if it can act independently. If the use of this power would cause harm, or be risky or uncertain in some way, roll PSYCHE for its effects when it is used, only manifesting and spending a burst on success. Otherwise, it always takes effect.",
