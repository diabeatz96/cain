It doesn’t take KP, and you can supernaturally form and reform it in your hands at will. <b>Make a (real) playlist of 6 songs at the start of each hunt.</b> Some of your powers key off this playlist. Any music you play from this playlist can be heard diagetically (in the game) if you so choose. It appears to come from either a visible location in short range, your player, or nowhere in particular (like a soundtrack), and you can turn it on and off at will.",
