    "powerDescription": "You say ‘Snap”, ‘Click’, or ‘Pop’, and produce an effect that would normally produce one of those sounds. For example, you could use ‘click’ to open a locked door, push a button, or type on a keyboard. You could use ‘snap’ to break a weapon or an arm. You could use ‘pop’ to blow a car tire or shoot a gun someone else is holding.\n\nIf necessary, roll PSYCHE for effects that would be risky, unclear, or inflict harm, and only spend a burst on success. Otherwise, this power is always successful. When you or an ally next acts to gain advantage of this power, they may gain +1D.",
