In this area you gain +1D to examine its contents and:\n        \n• you can cause any matter to become transparent or opaque \n• you can change the lighting in the room as though lit by an invisible light source, or snuff out any light sources in the room \n• you can move around any objects in the area without touching them and ‘pin’ them to any point in space in the area, causing them to float \n• you can safely dissect any loose inanimate object or furniture into its constituent parts or reassemble any broken object, providing any parts are present\n        \nThis effect expires when the scene ends, or if you leave the area for any reason.",
