    "powerDescription": "You flip a keyboard out from any object, construction, vehicle, human, or exorcist. The keyboard lasts until you produce a new one, or until the end of the scene. While the keyboard is out and you’re able to type on it, when gathering information on your subject, you can interact with them as if they were a computer. You may roll either PSYCHE or the interfacing skill, whichever is higher. The first time you do this for each keyboard, gain +1D. You can flip it out from even impossible surfaces, it may be made from unusual materials, and it does not harm a person it is produced from, although it is hard to type on them if they are unwilling or while they are moving.",
