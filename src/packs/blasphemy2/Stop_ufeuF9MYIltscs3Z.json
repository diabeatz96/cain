    "powerDescription": "You spend up to three psyche bursts to stop local time in an area around you equal to {<CAT> area 0}. Roll 1d6 per psyche burst spent and add them together - that is how many seconds you have. Anything that enters this area is immediately affected (including anything put into or out of the area), but time flows normally outside the area. In this stopped time, you are unaffected and: \n        \n• you cannot use psychic powers, but neither can you be affected by them. Any power currently active from you or affecting you other than this one dissipates. \n• you can perform one activity or course of action that fits in the duration. After you would make an action roll for anything, the effect ends no matter what. \n        \nThen, gain temporal instability.",
