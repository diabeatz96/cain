    "powerDescription": "You swap {<CAT> people 0} humans or exorcists with a different version of themselves from an alternate timeline. You must roll PSYCHE for this power to take effect on hostile targets, only spending a psyche burst on success. This can change:\n        \n• what the target is wearing, but not holding (so anything held in hand remains the same) \n• physical appearances of the targets, as your MIMIC power.\n        \nTargets retain their memories, and this does not alter reality to accommodate the change, so it can easily disorient unprepared humans. The change is otherwise perfect.\n        \nGain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power.",
