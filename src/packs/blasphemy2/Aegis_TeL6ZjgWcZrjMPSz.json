    "powerDescription": "When you or a visible ally in short range of you would mark stress from external harm, you can intervene by answering the following questions:\n        \n• Can you reach your target in time?\n• Is there any part of the environment you can use to shield your target?\n• Is your heart in this?\n        \nYou create a flash tension force of incredible strength, blocking damage. For each ‘yes’ answer, roll 1d6. For every 2+ rolled reduce stress suffered by 1, and for every 6 rolled reduce it by 2. This could reduce stress suffered to 0. \n\nAfter using this power, lose its use until you rest.",
