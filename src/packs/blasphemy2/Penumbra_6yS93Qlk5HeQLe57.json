    "powerDescription": "You create an area drawn as a large circle, encircling up to a {<CAT> area 1} size area, and choosing a type from the below list. The prison takes only a moment to create, but takes a few minutes to activate and for its effects to take place. It lasts until you rest or until used again.\n\n•A white mantle prevents entrance by Sins, but allows humans and exorcists to pass normally.\n•A black mantle prevents entrance by humans or exorcists. In addition, humans will (generally) be unable to see into the area and will act as if the area doesn't exist.\n• You can invert this effect if you so choose, preventing exit instead of entrance.\n\nThe prison can be broken by a determined supernatural attacker, but has a 4+CAT talisman for durability, taking stress like an execution talisman.",
