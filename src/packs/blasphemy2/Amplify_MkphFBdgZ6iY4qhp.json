    "powerDescription": "You can expand the mundane properties of a regular non-weapon item to extreme levels. You touch a mundane object up to CAT size. For the scene, you automatically have resonance with it, and its properties are enhanced to extreme levels, as if they were up to your CAT in scale. For example:\n        \n• A car’s speed, handling, and resilience\n• A light’s brightness and intensity, and the area it illuminates\n• A door’s ability to lock and withstand force\n        \nThis can easily affect the difficulty and risk of rolls.",
