    "powerDescription": "You temporarily remove almost all friction from a {<CAT> people 0} sized group of humans or exorcists, or an area up to {<CAT> area 0}. The area or target becomes incredibly slippery. If targeting an area, it becomes hard for anyone to stand, climb, or move normally in the area, though people are able to slide around. \n\n• Roll PSYCHE to affect hostile targets with this power, only spending a psyche burst on success. \n• You can sculpt this area if you wish to affect just part of it, or sculpt a path. \n\nGain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power. This power may also easily effect the parameters of rolls, such as difficulty and risk.",
