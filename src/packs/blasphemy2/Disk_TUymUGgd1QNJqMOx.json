    "powerDescription": "You touch an adjacent willing human or exorcist, or an object, vehicle, or construction of {<CAT> size 0} size (including anything on or inside that object), and store them as a CD, spending a psyche burst. You can keep a number of CDs equal to your CAT +1. They reset between missions, and their contents are freed. A person stored is in a stasis of sort and has no awareness or sensation, and cannot take harm or be affected in any way, though hooks, talismans, and afflictions on exorcists within can continue to build up, affecting them instantly on release if filled. When you touch the CD again, or if is broken before them, the stored person or object reappears in a space in short range of you, regardless of it there is room for it or not. Roll PSYCHE for any of its effects.",
