For unwilling or unaware targets, roll PSYCHE and only spend a burst and activate this power on a success.\n\nYou can see and speak normally from your eye and mouth, but they disappear on your face for the duration. You take any stress your eye or mouth would take as a consequence of your actions with them, and they return to your face when you end this power, or after they take harm.\n\nAdditionally, any number of times while active, you can take 1 sin to use a blasphemy power from any eye or mouth in {<CAT> range 2} range as if you were there, spending a psyche burst as normal. Gain +1D if doing so would grant you an advantage.",
