    "powerDescription": "Once a scene, you can create a spot tension field with a size determined by up to {<CAT> size 0} that appears as a large plane of shimmering force, invisible to humans. It can only exist as a flat plane (no bends or curves), and intersect or overlap any nonliving material, but otherwise is as hard as a solid object and prevents all living and nonliving matter and energy from crossing it. It has a 2+CAT talisman for its durability, which can take damage and be ticked up like an execution talisman by opponents. The field lasts until used again or until rest.",
