They are loyal to you, and you can determine their personality and appearance when you take this power.\n\nActive: You summon your tulpa, choosing one:\n\n• Have your tulpa aid you on a task related to research, crafting, or investigation, granting +1D on your next roll and making an extra slash on a talisman for each ‘6’ you roll.\n• Briefly manifest your tulpa outside your palace in short range as a real person, a mirror of their appearance inside your palace but dressed any way you like. They have roughly the capabilities of an average person (cat 0) and roll 2d for activities that a typical servant or butler could do and 0d for everything else. Any harm taken by them banishes them back to the palace.",
