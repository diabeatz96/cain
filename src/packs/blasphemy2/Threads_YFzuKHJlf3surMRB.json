Upon using this power, you close your eyes and can see through your eyelids the patterns the soul leaves in the environment.\n        \n• You gain the ability to see living beings, even through walls, for {<CAT> range 0} range\n• You can see the traces a sin or someone strong in grace such an exorcist leaves, like a faint trail of light through the air.\n• You gain +1D on actions to track or locate living beings or traces of sins in the area. However, you cannot see any non-living matter (you are effectively blind) while maintaining this power, and find actions that rely on sight hard\n        \nThis power ends when you open your eyes or when you rest.",
