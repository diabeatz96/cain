    "powerDescription": "Your powers have no effect if you can’t speak, or if sound is suppressed somehow. Using the same power from this blasphemy more than once before resting has ramping effects, which are not optional.\n\n• <b>Second time:</b> +1 CAT (min. CAT 2), take 1 irreducible stress.\n• <b>Third time:</b> +2 CAT (min CAT 3, max CAT 7), +1D, take 3 irreducible stress. Anyone in short range from you takes the defeaned affliction for the rest of the hunt ( hard on rolls that require hearing).\n• <b>Fourth time:</b> Power always resolves at CAT 7 and do not roll (automatic successes per die rolled). Afterwards, suffer instant death as your body is ripped apart by forces beyond comprehension, which cannot be ignored. Anyone in short range of you is permanently deafened.",
