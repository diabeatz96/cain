    "powerDescription": "When you sin overflow, you may gain a <b>Mother's Mark</b> instead of a regular sin mark, and roll 2d6, picking the lowest, if you choose to keep control.\n\n<b>Mother's Marks</b>\nA mother's mark does not lower sin overflow cap, but still counts as a sin mark in all other aspects. It has no other gameplay effects. Roll 1d6 for its aspect. You can gain the same mark more than once.\n\n<b>1. New eye</b> in center of forehead. Looks around on its own. You cannot see through it. <i>It is not yours.</i>\n<b>2. Large patch of skin or hair</b> loses all color, then gains banded stripes.\n<b>3. New pupil</b> in eye.\n<b>4. New tongue.</b>\n<b>5. New limb.</b> Elongated and double jointed.\n<b>6. Spiraling patterns,</b> warping the skin and muscle. Patterns change and shift over time.\n\nIf you lose control and have at least one Mother's Mark, you become subsumed into Mother, becoming a <b>Mother's Favorite</b> instead of an Imago. This is not a kind fate.",
