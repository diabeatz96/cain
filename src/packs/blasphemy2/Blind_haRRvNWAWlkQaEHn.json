Gain or grant +1D when you or any ally next acts to take advantage of this power: \n\n• Targeting a persona allows the effect to move with them for the scene \n• Targeting a location affects an area about the size of a small room, removing all sound and/or light. You can ‘filter’ this effect by allowing light or sound inside the location to operate normally, but not enter or exit the area. \n\nThis power may easily effect the parameters of rolls, such as difficulty and risk.",
