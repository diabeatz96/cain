    "domainDescription": "The hound feeds on fear, growing physically larger and stronger from the terror of weaker wills. Once a scene, if there are mundane humans within the local area, as a complication, the hound can manifest for them and start feeding off their fear. Until the exorcists calm the humans down or remove them from the situation, the hound takes -1 slash on its execution talisman from all sources and deals +1 more stress with reactions. Exorcists that attempt to harm the hound in any way must first spend 1 stress to suppress their fear. They can suppress this effect permanently as part of any action against the hound by answering the question, asked by the admin: What is it you are most afraid of? However, if they choose to answer, the Admin also rolls two risk dice and picks the lowest result for the triggering action.",
