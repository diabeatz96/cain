    "domainDescription": "The mere presence of the hound exacerbates the rifts between human and exorcist alike. Humans during this mission never start friendly to the exorcists and are often outwardly hostile. The Admin may make a fortune roll if they like (hostile on a 1-2, indifferent or annoyed otherwise). They may still become friendly through the exorcist’s actions. Any two exorcists that have a disagreement, no matter how minor, may declare it has boiled over into a fight. For the remainder of the hunt they cannot participate in teamwork with other and cannot set each other up. Any feuding exorcists regain a psyche burst if the other takes an injury or affliction, and both gain +1 xp at the end of the mission.",
