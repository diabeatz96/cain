At the start of the round in a conflict scene, the Lord can take one of the following stances. Exorcists that don’t fulfill the requirements are punished. It must switch to a different stance each round. \n• Honorable Fighting: Exorcists that participate in teamwork or setup first take 1d3 stress.\n• Grand Melee: Exorcists acting without benefiting from teamwork or setup find it hard. \n• Duel: The Lord chooses an exorcist. That exorcist deals +1 more slashes on the Lord’s execution talisman, but all other exorcists deal 1 less slash to the Lord this round.",
