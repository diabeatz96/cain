Often this draws on the superstitions of its host, often along mythological lines, and doesn’t have to conform to any real logic. \n• The hound takes -1 slash on its execution talisman. \n• This effect can be removed for a scene by the exorcists taking action to expose the hound to a specific weakness. The Admin can choose or roll from the list below: \n1. Silver 2. Iron 3. Extreme Heat 4. Extreme Cold 5. Water 6. Sunlight",
