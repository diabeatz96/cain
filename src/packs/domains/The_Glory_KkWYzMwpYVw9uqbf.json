    "domainDescription": "The idol is capable of taking a form that overwhelms the senses. \n\n• Once a scene, the Idol can take a glorious form as a complication. Non-cultist humans witnessing the form instantly become unconscious. Exorcists witnessing the form can either take 1 stress when acting against the idol and ignore it, or avert their gaze. If they avert their gaze, it becomes hard to do anything that relies on sight. \n\n• Cultists present in the scene are motivated by the idol and may re-roll the risk die when acting, taking the second result as final. \n\n• One exorcist sees this form as someone dear to them and must describe who to the group. They take 1 stress when harming the idol while the form is active.\n\n• This complication can be dealt with as normal.",
