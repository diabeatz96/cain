    "domainDescription": "The Centipede’s venom is so potent and fast spreading that it begins to cause catastrophic spread. \n• Double the casualties per pressure (to 20%). At full segments (6), the spread begins to go outside of the quarantine zone, requiring cleanup from CAIN and docking the exorcists 2 scrip. \n• When the players meet an NPC, the Admin makes a 1d6 fortune roll. On a ‘1-3’, they have already been bitten but are trying to hide it. \n• As a tension move, the Admin can choose an uninfected exorcist or NPC who has fought the infested at least once this mission. The Admin reveals they have been bitten, giving them a Centipede Bite.",
