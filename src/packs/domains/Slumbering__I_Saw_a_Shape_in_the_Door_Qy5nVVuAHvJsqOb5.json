On a 1, they immediately gain an idol affliction.\n\n• Once a hunt, as a tension move, the idol may immediately force the exorcists to rest for the next scene. This doesn’t tick tension, cannot progress pressure past 4, and the results of all their resting rolls are ‘1’ no matter what. During their rest they have disturbing daydreams. One exorcist may describe these to the group and gains 1d3 nonlethal stress.",
