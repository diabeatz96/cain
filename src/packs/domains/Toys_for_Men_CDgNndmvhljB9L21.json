    "domainDescription": "The idol gains the ability to play with the flesh of others like marionettes. Cultists gain +1 segment on their execution talisman (so a lone cultist would have 3) as they can keep moving even while their body is broken, jerked by invisible strings. The idol gains a new affliction: COLLECT DOLL: When afflicted, the exorcist loses control of one of their arms. It becomes doll-like in texture and appearance. Once a scene, the idol can interfere with an action the exorcist is performing as the hand interferes, forcing them to either take 1 stress or make the action hard.",
