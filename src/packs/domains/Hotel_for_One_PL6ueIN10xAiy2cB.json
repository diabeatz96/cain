    "domainDescription": "The toad is able to use its powerful lungs to suck people into its maw, where they are shunted into a tiny prison-space inside its gullet. As a complication the Toad can suck in an exorcist it is fighting. That exorcist is trapped inside a tiny cage-like extra-dimensional room inside the toad and takes 1 stress before acting while imprisoned until they can escape or their allies can help them escape (set out a talisman for the complication as normal). They are vomited out when they are able to break out of their cage. As a tension move, the Toad can kidnap any NPC the exorcists have met off-screen and imprison them in its oubliette, mostly unharmed. Freeing them requires fighting the Toad and may take a talisman.",
