    "domainDescription": "The hound gains a special affinity for firearms. It can attack at range with guns that it wields or, more often, are fused to its form, emerging when needed. \n\n• The hound’s attacks gain CAT+2 range. \n\n• As a complication, the hound pins an exorcist down by bullets, bathes them in napalm, concusses them with grenades, etc. That exorcist takes 1 stress after acting until the complication is dealt with, or takes 2 stress if acting requires moving from their current position. \n\n• As a reaction (1) the hound can permanently absorb all firearms in a CAT area around it, immediately disarming anyone wielding one, and healing 1 tick on the execution talisman if it absorbed at least one firearm.",
