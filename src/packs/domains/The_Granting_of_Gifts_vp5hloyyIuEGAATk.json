    "domainDescription": "The toad is an especially powerful hoarder, and keeps quantitites of strange items to regurgitate in an emergency. As a reaction (1-3), the Toad can forcibly regurgitate items from its gullet. This can inflict stress, cause a threat or cause a complication as normal. However, roll randomly for the category of item it produces, which may affect the outcome: \n1. Vehicle, drivable.\n 2. Explosives \n3. Weapons, ammunition \n4. Narcotics \n5. Material wealth (gold bars, jewels, etc) \n6. Alcohol (in liquid or bottle form) Then roll randomly for the size or volume (1d3). Adjust stress suffered by the amount shown if dealing stress. 1. Comically smaller than expected (-1 stress) 2. Expected 3. Unbelievably larger than expected (+1 stress)",
