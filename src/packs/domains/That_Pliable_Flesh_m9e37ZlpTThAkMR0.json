    "domainDescription": "The idol can twist its form rapidly and shape shift. \n\n• As a tension move, reveal in a scene at any point that someone the exorcists are talking to is actually the idol. All exorcists that witness this take 1 stress. This can force a conversation or a conflict scene. \n\n• As a complication in a conflict scene, the idol can rapidly shape shift into an exact copy of one of the exorcists. Until the complication is dealt with, when the idol would take slashes on its execution talisman, roll a d6. On a 1-2, reduce the slashes to 0 and the doubled exorcist takes 2 stress as it becomes impossible to distinguish between the two.",
