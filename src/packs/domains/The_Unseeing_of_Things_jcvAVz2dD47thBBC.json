It becomes hard to do anything to the ogre unless it is brightly lit or an action doesn’t rely on sight. As a tension move, all electric lights not held by an exorcist sputter out and cease functioning until pressure increases again. The Admin immediately picks an exorcist and asks them ‘What do you see in the dark?’. They must answer truthfully and gain 1d3 nonlethal stress after answering.",
