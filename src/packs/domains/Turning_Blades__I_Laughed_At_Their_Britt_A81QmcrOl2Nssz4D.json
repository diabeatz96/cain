    "domainDescription": "The hound’s hide becomes incredibly tough and durable, like a beast’s. \n\n• Each time an action would slash the hound’s execution talisman, roll a 1d6 fortune roll. If the roll is a 1 or 2, reduce all slashes suffered to 1. The hound’s armor has weak spots, however, and any action that is set up or part of teamwork can ignore this effect. \n• Mundane weapons are completely incapable of harming the hound unless they are extremely strong, like a tank cannon or a missile.",
