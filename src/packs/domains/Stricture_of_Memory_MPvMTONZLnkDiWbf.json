    "domainDescription": "The lord’s power is regressive and nostalgic. Inside its Kingdom, it returns everything to a previous era (real or imagined) desirable to its host, such as the European middle ages, Edo Japan, 1950s America, or 1st century Judea. Weapons, gear, and technology that would not exist in that era are converted into similar equivalents inside the Kingdom, or simply do not exist while inside the Kingdom. For example firearms becoming crossbows, or a GPS system becoming a hand drawn map. If the Admin judges this would affect a roll, they can make it hard. All clothing, hairstyles, etc also changes to fit. They revert upon exiting.",
