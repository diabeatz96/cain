    "domainDescription": "The idol has major connections with the human world: fans, businessmen, or politicians. This presents an expanding problem for CAIN cleanup. Cultists are now armed with short ranged firearms and body armor, dealing +1 stress with reactions. Increase their execution talisman by +1. \n\n• Set out an exposure talisman, of 10 length. Whenever the exorcists engage in a conflict scene, tick it up by 1d3. If the exorcists do something else loud, violent, or with high exposure, tick it up by 1, but no more than once a scene. \n\n• If the talisman is 3 or more, local authorities will start to attempt to arrest the exorcists. If it’s 6 or more, the response becomes more severe in scale. Exorcists can attempt to untick this talisman with their actions. If the talisman fills up before the idol is dealt with, cleanup becomes catastrophic as the news spreads beyond CAIN control. The exorcists will receive no scrip pa y for the mission.",
