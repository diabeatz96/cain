Once a scene, during any scene, the Admin may declare that the exorcist gets a glimpse of the hound following them (though it may or may not be real), giving them 1 stress, which cannot inflict an injury. The Admin can trigger this three times total a hunt. In any conflict scene, the Hound gets a free reaction at the start (roll the risk die as normal), targeting the exorcist it is stalking if possible.",
