When the centipede’s execution clock is filled up, it instead reduces by 4. The centipede then takes on a terrifying final form. \n• End the current round and start a new round \n• In this form, roll the risk die twice and choose the lower result, the centipede takes -1 slash on its talisman and deals +1 stress with all its actions. \n• However, this form is extremely unstable. At the end of the round, after all exorcists have acted, no matter what, the centipede’s form destabilizes, instantly defeating it and allowing the exorcists the opportunity to finish it off.",
