    "domainDescription": "The Toad stores brainwashed humans inside its gullet, and pulls them out as needed. Humans stored this way are freed when the toad is defeated and have no memory of the incident. \n\n• The Toad can pull out a human to perform any mundane servile task for it, such as cooking, cleaning, driving, etc. They are completely obedient to the toad and always come out with something convenient to the current situation, such as a guard with a door key, a taxi driver, etc. \n\n• It can pull out a goon as a (1-3) r eaction in a conflict scene. This creates a toadspawn trace with an execution talisman of 1, or adds +1 to an existing trace’s execution talisman. \n\n• As a threat in any conflict scene, the toad can kidnap a mundane human or NPC present, brainwashing them and adding to its collection.",
