On this mission, the Admin, choosing for the Lord can forbid three items from the following list: \n• Swearing \n• Speaking the name of the Lord or its host (in vain or otherwise) \n• Uncovering skin between the ankles, wrists, and neck in view of the opposite sex \n• Drinking, eating, or smoking anything not blessed by the Lord \n• Touching another person skin to skin without consent of the Lord \n• Entering the palace of the Lord without praying first \n\nThese rules become known instantly to anyone upon entering the kingdom. Once a scene, when an exorcist would break one of these rules, they take 2d3 stress. If the Admin misses an occurrence of one of these rules being broken but an exorcist reminds them, that exorcist can gain 1 xp. This can only trigger once a session per exorcist.",
