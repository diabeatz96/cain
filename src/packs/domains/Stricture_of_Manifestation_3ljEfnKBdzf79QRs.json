It can use these as threats or complications: \n\n• Cause any object up to CAT+1 size to coalesce and appear in a few moments. \n• Invert or choose the direction and strength of gravity, or even make space curved\n • Change the weather or change the biome of an area, such as from sunny to snowy \n• Rearrange the interiors and layouts of buildings, streets, or corridors In addition, as a threat or a tension move, the Lord can dismiss any psychic power caused by the exorcists that has a sustained effect (like a summon or curse). This only works inside the kingdom.",
