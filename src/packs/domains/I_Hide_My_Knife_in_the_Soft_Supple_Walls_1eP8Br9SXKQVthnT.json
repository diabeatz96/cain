    "domainDescription": "The Centipede is able to set festering traps for the exorcists, extruding parts of its body or using the transformed flesh of its infested horde. As a tension move, the Admin can declare that for the next scene, the exorcists are about to enter a trapped area (even if they have already explored it). Moving through the area becomes risky by default. Traps can: inflict 1 stress to one or two exorcists, make an area dangerous or hard to move through, afflict an exorcist, inflict a hook. In addition, in any conflict scene with the Centipede, on a ‘1’ risk result a trap also goes off, with the above effects, in addition to any other reactions.",
